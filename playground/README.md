## Experiment 1 - Evaluating decision making with Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement Learning Environment:
* Observation states: [throw success] ongoing, throwaway, win
* Action space: [throws] 
* Reward Function: 
    - number of throws
    - distance travelled from start
    - gainer / distance travelled
    - point won: +100 if 80 < y < 100

- [X] Fetch data: use royals 2022 data first
- [ ] Initialize `Throwing` classes with season dataset
    - [ ] Compute Field probability beforehand (for each rectangle in field)
- [ ] Make environment: 
- [ ]
