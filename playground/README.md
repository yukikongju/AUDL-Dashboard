## Experiment 1 - Evaluating decision making with Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement Learning Environment:
* Observation states: [throw success] ongoing, throwaway, win
* Action space: [throws] 
* Reward Function: 
    - number of throws
    - distance travelled from start
    - gainer / distance travelled
    - point won: +100 if 80 < y < 100
